# Godot3-RiskOfRainClone
Cloning an existing game, so I can learn Godot, C# and game programming in general

I Have chosen Risk of Rain as I am playing it right now. Not having to bother with
game design allows me to focus on the other stuff.

If someone is able to learn something from it - that will be wonderful. That is why
I'm putting this out to github.
